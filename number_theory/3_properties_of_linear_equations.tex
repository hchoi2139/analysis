\section{Properties of ax + by = c}

\begin{theorem}[Linear Equation Theorem]
  The equation $ax + by = c$ has integer solution pairs if and only if $gcd(a, b)\mid c$. The solution is expressible by $(x_{1} + \dfrac{kb}{g}, y_{1} - \dfrac{ka}{g})$ where $k\in \mathbb{Z}$, $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ a trivial solution.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
To prove it, apply Euclidean algorithm. I omit the specifics.
