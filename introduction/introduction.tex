\chapter{Introduction}
A solid foundation in mathematics, including topology, real and complex analysis, 
is of paramount importance for individuals pursuing studies in natural sciences 
and engineering. This article is written at the request of my friend, an enthusiastic physicist
and a Pleiades cluster lover, who currently is serving for obligatory military service,
but wants to keep track of his study. However, I hope this article serves as a helpful
resource for students, future or current researchers, and enthusiasts in various
fields, including natural sciences and engineering.
