\chapter{Introduction}
A solid foundation in mathematics, including number theory, topology, real and  complex analysis, is of paramount importance for individuals pursuing studies in natural sciences and engineering. This article is written at the request of my friend, an enthusiastic physicist and a Pleiades cluster lover, who currently is serving for obligatory military service, but wants to keep track of his study. However, I hope this article serves as a helpful resource for students, future or current researchers, and enthusiasts in various fields, including natural sciences and engineering. \\
Though I said that solid foundation in mathematics is important, this article is not mathematically strict. Of course I provide proofs for important theorems or features, but it omits a lot of proofs. The aim of this article is not to be a lecture note for students, but to provide intuition or serve as a cheat sheet.
